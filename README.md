Firefox-on-OS-X Label
============

Add a text label (editable through a preference setting) to your Firefox icons in OS X (only). If you're running Firefox with multiple profiles on OS X, you know you want this.

Inspired by custom-badge by evacchi, who first showed that this was even possible. Thanks!
